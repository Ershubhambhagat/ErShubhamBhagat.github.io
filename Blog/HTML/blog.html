          let Internet users bypass mandatory free registration on websites.</h2>

          <p class="text"><h4>Excellent for sites with annoying "login required" to view stuff </h4></p>

          <p class="text">Many sites require you to register just to see a simple video or read a review... etc. Even if this
            registration is free if you stumble on a
            site that you are unlikely to visit again, creating yet another registration is a haste.BugMeNot.com will
            help you quickly bypass the login of
            web sites that require compulsory registration and/or the collection of personal/demographic information.
            The service is quite good as you only
            have to enter the site you need to log into and some other user would have shared credentials.</p>
          <!-- <p>BugMeNot allows users of their service to add new accounts for sites with free registration. It also encourages users to use disposable email address services to create such accounts. However, it does not allow them to add accounts for paid websites, as this could potentially lead to credit card fraud.[3] BugMeNot also claims to remove accounts for any website requesting that they do not provide accounts for non-registered users. </p>-->

          <!-- <p> To help make access to their service easier, BugMeNot hosts a bookmarklet that can be used with any browser to automatically find a usable account from their service. They also host extensions for the web browsers Mozilla Firefox (but not on Firefox quantum yet), Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome (the extensions were created by Eric Hamiter with Dmytri Kleiner and Dean Wilson, respectively). There are also implementations in the form of a BugMeNot Opera widget, or UserJS scripts along with buttons, which makes it fully browser-integrated. An Android application is also available</p> -->
